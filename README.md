# NAPKILL SMARTBIN

## Problem Statement
Improper disposal of sanitary napkins causes environmental pollution, health risks, and unhygienic conditions, especially in public and institutional washrooms.

## Solution Overview
NAPKILL SMARTBIN is a smart sanitary waste disposal system that uses solar-thermal incineration to safely dispose used sanitary napkins. The system ensures hygienic, controlled, and eco-friendly waste management.

## Dashboard Concept
A conceptual real-time monitoring dashboard is designed to visualize system performance. The dashboard displays napkin usage count, chamber temperature, system status, solar heat availability, process stages, environmental impact, and safety alerts.

## Data Used
The dashboard uses assumed sample data for demonstration purposes during the prototype stage. In real deployment, live sensor data will be integrated into the system.

## Future Scope
In future implementation, IoT sensors and Power BI will be used to create a real-time dashboard for continuous monitoring, safety control, and data-driven insights.

## Conclusion
NAPKILL SMARTBIN provides a safe, sustainable, and scalable solution for sanitary waste disposal with scope for smart monitoring and analytics.
